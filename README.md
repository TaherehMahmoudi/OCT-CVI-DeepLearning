# Introduction
This project aims to calculate Choroid Vascularity Index (CVI) in optical coherenece tomography (OCT) images, using loss modified U-Net. 
The method is detailed in "Automatic Choroid Vascularity Index Calculation in Optical Coherence Tomography Images low contrast sclerochoroidal junction Using Deep Learning".

# Dependencies
  •	Python 3.7+
  
  •	Tensorflow 1.15.2
  
  •	Keras


# Dataset
We used Enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography images from two patient groups. 

 •	First dataset is including Raster OCT B-scans from patients with diabetic retinopathy (here).
 
 •	Second dataset is including EDI-HD OCT B-scans from patients with pachychoroid spectrum (here).
